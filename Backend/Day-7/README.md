# To-Do API — Advanced

GOW AI Academy — Backend Internship | Day 7

An advanced To-Do REST API focused on backend state management and partial updates. Supports creating, completing, reverting, filtering, and deleting tasks with proper field-level validation.

---

## Concepts Covered

- Backend state management (completed / pending toggle)
- Partial updates — only update the fields provided
- Status-based filtering using query parameters
- PATCH vs PUT: semantically correct HTTP methods
- Field-level validation with descriptive errors

---

## Task Structure

```json
{
  "id": "1",

  "updatedAt": "2026-05-25T10:00:00.000Z"
